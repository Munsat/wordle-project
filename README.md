# wordle-project
Project submission for GA flex course



1. Create 5 boxes and necessary lines depending on level of difficulty for user entry

1. Create a keyboard with backspace and enter (just uppercase)

1. User should be able to click and use keyboard to enter letter

1. Enter should be disabled before all letters are filled. Once filled, enter should do an alert if the word is not in vocabulary

1. If in vocab, check if the any letter present is correct and in right place, then make it green; if letter is present but in wrong place, make it yellow; all other letter should be grey

1. Once all lines are filled, and the word is not right, then show GAMEOVER, otherwise show YOU'VE WON!

1. Keep track of score 

## Things to fix
- need to add styling

   - Hard: 3 guesses
   - Medium: 6 guesses
   - Easy: 10 guesses


1. Maybe add in soundeffects at the end
