## Wordle Game


My version of Wordle is called My Wordle. It is very similar to the actual Wordle game where the user have to guess the word in 6 chances and with each chance they are provided with clues as colored tiles.

1. User should be able to click and use keyboard to enter letter

1. Enter should be disabled before all letters are filled. Once filled, enter should do an alert if the word is not in vocabulary

1. If in vocab, check if the any letter present is correct and in right place, then make it green; if letter is present but in wrong place, make it yellow; all other letter should be grey

1. Once all lines are filled, and the word is not right, then show GAMEOVER, otherwise show YOU'VE WON!
